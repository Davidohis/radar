    In our Final Event we will revisit your TechLabs journey this semester, present your
    project work and celebrate your collaborative learning effort together!

    After a short introduction, each group has the chance to present their elevator pitch to their
    fellow participants. Afterwards we'll have a short feedback round as well as a Q&A. Please make sure that at least
    one member of your team is available to present your project and answer questions.
