    You can apply for TechLabs Berlin **until Friday, April 17**. All you need to do is to complete the application
    form linked below.

    Please note that the survey consists of several questions, some of them require you to reflect on yourself.
    This is intentional and ensures that we can build a community of very smart and motivated learners.
    In that way you can be sure that your learning experience will be awesome and that you'll all have a great time.
    On the other hand, it also means you'll have to invest 20 to 30 minutes. But it'll be worth it, we promise!

    We will post instructions how to choose your track in the Kick-Off Session.

    Please complete the following steps to choose your track:

    1. Create an account at [edyoucated](https://bln.techlabs.org/JOINEDY): [**bln.techlabs.org/JOINEDY**](https://bln.techlabs.org/JOINEDY)
    1. After logging in, choose **TechLabs Berlin**.
    1. Complete the track personalization survey.
    1. Back at edyoucated, confirm that you finished the survey.

    After we've received all of your choices, we will evaluate your answers in the track personalization survey.
    Then we will assign you to a track on edyoucated and you can start learning. Please allow some time between
    you completing the survey and the track assignment as this process involves some manual steps. We will send you a
    message on Slack as soon as you can access your track material on edyoucated.
